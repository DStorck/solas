# Slack notifications

[Slack notifications](https://samsung-cnct.slack.com/apps/search?q=github) can be used to make developers aware of PR/issue and release activiy. To implement this you will need [Admin Privileges](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/). To ensure that you are not the only one who can maintain these integrations, it is recommended that you grant a GitHub Team (e.g. `commontools`) permissions and not a single individual contributor.  The default notification level for the github integration can be noisy so you only want to have the following Events notify slack:
    - Commit Events
        - Commits pushed to the repository
            - Only show commit summaries (no commit messages)
    - Issue / Pull Request Events
        - Pull request open or closed
        - Issues opened or closed
        - Only show titles of new issues and pull requests
    - Other Events
        - Branch or tag created or deleted
        - Branch force-pushed
